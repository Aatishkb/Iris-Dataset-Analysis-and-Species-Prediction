# Iris-Dataset-Analysis-and-Species-Prediction

Welcome to the Iris Species Prediction repository! This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the species of an iris flower based on its morphological characteristics. The Iris dataset, a classic in the field of data science, serves as the foundation for this project.

## Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample having four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The dataset includes three species of iris:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Using these features, the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on new input data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features using libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict the species of new iris samples.

## Thank You!
